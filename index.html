          Interested in playing Minecraft but don't know where or how to start?
          That's okay, we got you covered. We'll cover hot to start, what to do
          when you start, and the very basics so you can start playing and enjoy
          the game!

        <h2>Getting started</h2>

      <div class="starting">

          The first thing you need to do is figure out which version you want to
          play. There are two editions of the game, Java and Bedrock. The Java
          edition is the original edition created by Mojang, it is compatible
          with PC, Mac, and Linux. The Bedrock edition is the edition created by
          Microsoft after they bought the rights to Minecraft, it is compatible
          with any device that has Windows 10, apple, android, and there are
          console verisons.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="edition">
        <h3>But which one should I get?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="difference">
        <p>
          Well, that's entirely up to you. The Java edition has lots of free
          mods because it's been around so long. However, the Bedrock edition
          supports cross-platform playing. So your decision should come down to
          if you want lots of cool stuff or play with friends who want to play
          on a different device.

        <h3>How to download</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="downloading">
        <p>
          To download the game there a few things you can do:<br /><br />
          1) If purchasing the Java edition got to Minecraft.net, create an
          account and purchase the game from their site. <br /><br />
          2) If buying Windows 10, got to the Windows store and follow the
          directions provided. <br /><br />
          3) Go to Amazon and buy a key code for which edition you want and
          redeem it at either the minecraft website (for Java edition) or the
          Windows store (for Windows 10 edition).<br /><br />
          From there follow the installation steps. Now you are ready to start
          plying!

        <h2>Where to start in the game</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="play">
        <p>
          You're all set up and ready to go, but... how do you start?<br /><br />
          First things first, you need to build a shelter. Night comes fast when
          you first start and it's dangerous in the world. The easiest way to
          build a shelter is to punch trees. Yes, punch trees. Until you have
          enough inventory to create items your best bet is to punch trees to
          get the lumber they drop. Creating equipment takes time and it's
          better to have a shelter first and try messing around with equipment
          later. <br /><br /><br />
          One suggestion is to punch the ground to lower the level of the floor
          of your shelter, this will save you resources when you build the walls
          and roof of the shelter. Next, once you've collected the item drops
          from those punched trees place them around the area you want to make a
          shelter, you will need to use some of them as a stepping stone to
          reach the higher parts and make a roof. If you lowered the floor then
          you only need two blocks high for your walls. Another suggestion for
          saving resources is to find a spot where you can use the landscape as
          one of your walls, just make sure you don't leave any gaps as some
          mobs can get through!
          <br /><br />
          Now that you have a shelter you can spend time looking for other
          resources. With the extra lumber you should make three specific tools;
          axe, shovel, and pickaxe. These are the three that you will use most.
          Also, creating a sword will help if you find yourself getting caught
          out late. Start with making these from wood, later you can upgrade to
          stone, wood should be the most common resource (unless you're in the
          desert).<br /><br />
          After the first nightfall, think about where you want your base and
          how big to start with. The base can be adjusted later but keep in mind
          you'll need space for a bed and some crafting tables. If needed, start
          with expanding the base.<br />
          <br />Once it's to your desired size you'll need to start looking for
          resources to create the items you want. You should make a chest or two
          to store items in, placing two chests next to each other makes them
          one big chest. You should make a few extra of each tool and store them
          in the chest for later. <br /><br />
          One thing you need to make is a bed, a bed makes it so you can skip
          night. To make a bed you need wool, wool is collected from sheep.
          Depending on the area you are in it may be difficult to find sheep,
          which means you need to adventure out to find them. BE CAREFUL when
          adventuring! If you don't have a compass then you may not be able to
          find your way back to your base. It's best to leave "bread crumbs",
          building tall towers can serve as excellent bread crumbs to help you
          find your way back. Once you find a sheep there are two things you can
          do, one is to kill the sheep and collect it's wool. The other is to
          bring the sheep back with you so when you have shears you can collect
          the wool without killing the sheep. To lure the sheep back to base you
          will need wheat, sheep will follow you if you have wheat in your hand
          and are close enough to them. <br /><br />
          Now go out and have fun!
