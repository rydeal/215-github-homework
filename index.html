          Interested in playing Minecraft but don't know where or how to start?
          That's okay, we got you covered. We'll cover hot to start, what to do
          when you start, and the very basics so you can start playing and enjoy
          the game!

        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>
          The first thing you need to do is figure out which version you want to
          play. There are two editions of the game, Java and Bedrock. The Java
          edition is the original edition created by Mojang, it is compatible
          with PC, Mac, and Linux. The Bedrock edition is the edition created by
          Microsoft after they bought the rights to Minecraft, it is compatible
          with any device that has Windows 10, apple, android, and there are
          console verisons.
        </p>
        <h3>But which one should I get?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, that's entirely up to you. The Java edition has lots of free
          mods because it's been around so long. However, the Bedrock edition
          supports cross-platform playing. So your decision should come down to
          if you want lots of cool stuff or play with friends who want to play
          on a different device.
